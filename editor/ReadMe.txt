The editor requires icons.bmp and walls.bmp in order to operate properly.

It can use a 32x32 map, or you can use 4 16x16 ones.

You should be able to create a sample map fairly quickly.

If you wish to suggest any new icons, let me know. There are obviously quite a few spaces open.

Editor should build with minimal tweaking. You may need to include msimg32.lib for transparency stuff.

Maps for the Apple game Shadowkeep are included in the samples directory. They were before I deciphered the binary encoding.
