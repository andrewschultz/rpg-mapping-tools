# Ancient Legends readme

Ancient Legends is a game created in 2016 by Seth Sternberg of Eight Bit Weapon for Apple II or Apple II emulators. I am grateful to have been a part of this. I tested the game. It was presented at 2016 at KansasFest, a gathering of Apple II fans.

Ancient Legends is a small-sized game that shows off the main features of the Outlaw Editor, which is also on GitHub. It has a handful of towns and castles and dungeons. While the main project is Lawless Legends, AL was created just to show a full game could be made.

I'll avoid too much subjective commentary on the game because I'm biased, but I liked the game enough to write maps for it.

So this small subdirectory has the raw materials for converting the data from Ancient Legends into a bitmap. I may include how I derived things later (the script for that is a bit hard coded) but for now, it's just

* the icon file
* the derived bitmap file
* the nmr (new map routine) file stating what parts of the main bitmap map to what parts of the game

Still to add:

* the XTR file, which designates things like fights or exit squares
* a revised extraction script that removes some of the hard-coding and manual manipulation
