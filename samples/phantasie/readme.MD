*PHANTASIE SERIES MAPS*

I thought Phantasie would be a good series to make sample maps for, because it's slightly tricky to pull out those maps.

They break across 256-byte sectors, so you can't just read them straight, and if you search too long, you'll get garbage.

I suppose I could've written an app that reshuffles the 100-byte blocks, but I only needed a few changes for mapcpy. Maybe I'll write things later.

Back in ~2000 I originally wrote a program to extract the maps for each game, so I'm glad to have mapcpy to pull them all together now.

Phantasie I and II seem to have similar dimensions, but Phantasie III has an upgraded engine and also different dimensions to the dungeons and outside.

Odd trivia: the Commodore map is the Apple map rotated 90 degrees. I don't know why, but it is.
