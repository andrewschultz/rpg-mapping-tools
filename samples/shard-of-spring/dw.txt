# this file can be cleaned up a lot, but right now, it pretty much pokes at the file I used
# by decompressing SUM.MAP. I could eventually read right from SUM.MAP, but until then, the
# binary file keeps it simple. Well, relatively. Bytes are compressed so they're inserted
# vertically, which goes against mapcpy reading left to right.
#
# dw.pl contains details on the compression, which is neat and tidy.
