# samples directory

There are a lot of subdirectories here. More specifically, there's one for each series. If a series isn't mentioned specifically below, it means there's only one game tracked.

* 2400 AD is a one-player top-down RPG with cute bright graphics. It's the first one I ever wrote maps for on my own. I had a Geocities website way back when. I've included files to derive maps from the Apple and PC versions.
* Ancient Legends is, ironically, the most recent of these games, published in 2016.
* The Magic Candle Series has a bunch of games: Magic Candle (), II and III are the most obvious, but Rings of Zilfin was a precursor, Keys to Maramon was between I and II, and Bloodstone was the final entry. Apparently more were planned.
* Phantasie was a 3-game series from SSI. There is a Phantasie IV for the MSX and Winston Douglas Wood has planned Phantasie V in his spare time, but that is a way off.
* Questron's most obvious games are Questron and Questron 2. However, Legacy of the Ancients and Legend of Blacksilver are even better games that build on the engine.
* Shard of Spring is another series from SSI. Its sequel is Demon's Winter, which I disliked until I was able to make a map and actually play the game.
* Wizard's Crown and Eternal Dagger were a short-lived RPG series from SSI (again!) that seemed like they'd have a sequel, but it never happened.
