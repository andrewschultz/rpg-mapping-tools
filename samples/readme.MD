# samples directory

There are a lot of subdirectories here. More specifically, there's one for each series. If a series isn't mentioned specifically below, it means there's only one game tracked. Most of these games are Apple and/or PC, but often I go with the PC version of the game, because it's easier to extract the maps. You can pretty much find a file labeled map.* or *.map. Or there are a lot of files with the same dimensions, and they're not icon files.

* 2400 AD is a one-player top-down RPG with cute bright graphics. It's the first one I ever wrote maps for on my own (I wrote Deathlord maps with Wilson Lau). I had a Geocities website way back when. I've included files to derive maps from the Apple and PC versions.
* Ancient Legends is, ironically, the most recent of these games, published in 2016. It has a sequel under development, Lawless Legends.
* The *Magic Candle Series* has a bunch of games: Magic Candle (), II and III are the most obvious, but Rings of Zilfin was a precursor, Keys to Maramon was between I and II, and Bloodstone was the final entry. Apparently more were planned.
* Moebius/Windwalker featured more action than exploring but still had a few maps and was in Quest for Clues, so I gave them a shot.
* Phantasie was a 3-game series from SSI. There is a Phantasie IV for the MSX and Winston Douglas Wood has planned Phantasie V in his spare time, but that is a way off.
* Questron's most obvious games are Questron and Questron 2. However, Legacy of the Ancients and Legend of Blacksilver are even better games that build on the engine.
* Shard of Spring is another series from SSI. Its sequel is Demon's Winter, which I disliked until I was able to make a map and actually play the game and not get crushed or lost all the time.
* Ultima I-V are pretty clearly tile based. Ultima VI uses more complex tiles, and Akalabeth's dungeons and overland are randomly generated.
* Wizard's Crown and Eternal Dagger were a short-lived RPG series from SSI (again!) that seemed like they'd have a sequel, but it never happened.

Note that a lot of games with 3-d views, such as Might and Magic, aren't currently included. They are in the sister directory samples-3d.

Also note some games may be partially included. For instance, Bard's Tale has a 2-d map for Skara Brae, which can be included here.

# future projects (?)

## Very Likely

* Sundog (may write guide too)
* BT1/2/3 town maps (dungeons would be in 3-d)

## Likely, Plus Guide

* Secrets of Bahras  (Apple IIgs)

## Conditional

* Deathlord (would require compression reading)
* Gemstone Healer/Warrior (maybe just room maps)
* Legend of Blacksilver (part of Questron but maybe not enough--I can extract from disks and maybe use icon files too)
* Might and magic i/ii (might be 3d)
* Wasteland (save states only?)
* Uukrul
* Apshai Trilogy (?)
* Realms of Darkness
* Realm of Impossibility

## non Apple

* Bikkuriman World (NES, have major maps)
* Rolan's Curse (GBA)
* Labyrinth (NES)
* Ultima: Runes of Virtue I/II (save states?)
