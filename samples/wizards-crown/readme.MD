This is the directory for Wizard's Crown and Eternal Dagger.

The maps are pretty much all the same shape and size at 30x30, whether they are outside maps or dungeon maps.

The disk files have some red herrings that look like maps but are actually ways to determine what happens to a player if they walk on a certain square, or conversations that are tripped.

Though Eternal Dagger was the sequel, Wizard's Crown was bigger.

Wizard's Crown has 7 outside areas, all linked. Eternal Dagger has 4, in 3 parts. Well, 5 if you count the small islands.

Wizard's Crown has 12 dungeon areas. Eternal Dagger has 9.
