# Directory of extraction files for 2400 AD

2400 AD is a small top down RPG written in 1988 by Chuck "Chuckles" Bueche. It's funny and colorful and forces you into a sort of civil disobedience that clashes with the usual serious "kill others and gain experience points."

You will need the Apple disk images from Asimov to run this successfully. If you read 2400.txt, you may see how the Apple groups memory blocks. The game has several physical levels, so I had to create a lot of sub-maps.

Contents:

* 2400.txt is the file to run the script on e.g. mapcpy 2400.txt
* 2400.ahs is the icon file
* 2400.nmr is the file you run mapconv on e.g. mapconv 2400.nmr
