# Directory of extraction files for 2400 AD

2400 AD is a small top down RPG written in 1988 by Chuck "Chuckles" Bueche. It's funny and colorful and forces you into a sort of civil disobedience that clashes with the usual serious "kill others and gain experience points."

You will need the Apple disk images from Asimov to run this successfully. If you read 2400.txt, you may see how the Apple groups memory blocks. The game has several physical levels, so I had to create a lot of sub-maps. Some only have one small area.

## List of main contents:

* 2400.txt is the file to run the script on e.g. mapcpy 2400.txt if you download the files from [asimov](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/games/rpg/2400ad/)
* 2400.ahs is the icon file
* 2400.nmr is the file you run mapconv on e.g. mapconv 2400.nmr
* 2400pc.txt is the file to run the script on if you downloaded the PC version. You only need MAP.A and MAP.B.
