# Ultima I-V mapping

Some of these are trivial because I've already done a lot more with my Ultima IV and V maps. Nevertheless, I've used PC map files from I-V to create the maps here.

Most are 64x64 or 16x16, making it easy to render complete maps.

Ultima VI uses tiles, which are a bit more complex, and there are apps that do a far better job of drawing a map, which is more detailed anyway.
