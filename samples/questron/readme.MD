# Questron and Questron style maps

## Questron

I used the Apple disks for this.

This got me to implement by-nibble maps, with high or low nibble first.

## Questron 2

Taken from the PC version, because it's easier.

Most are in a byte to byte mode except the catacombs, which are bit-by-bit. They are T29.MAP and T30.MAP.

The maps have a 12 byte header with the width in byte 0 and the height in byte 2.

### Legacy of the Ancients

Taken from the PC version, because it's easier.

The town maps may be scrambled from what I have on GameFAQs, because I just wanted to dump them, and I can reorganize them later.

Note most files are *.BSV except for the castles/forts which are *.BS(1/2).

### Legend of Blacksilver

The towns are compressed on the Commodore/Apple versions so I wasn't able to map them clearly.
