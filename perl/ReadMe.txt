This is where I will lump particularly useful PERL files that can be used.

ssfrom.pl manipulates NES emulator save states. Once you know where the map begins, or where x- or y-coordinates are, you can run this so that you have save states that cover everywhere.

There is room for further improvements, but I'm largely using this in order to give myself PERL scripts that would be really hard to parse with C.
