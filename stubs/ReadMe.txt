This is a directory with a few small stubs.

cg.bat simply kicks me to c:\coding\games\(whichever project)

CG could be improved by giving myself a default project as an environment variable.

mc.bat is a quick converter. With one argument, it runs mapcpy then mapconv on (ARG1). With two, mapcpy (1) mapconv (2).

Nothing terribly deep but it's always nice to save keystrokes.
