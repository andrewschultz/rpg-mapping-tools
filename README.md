# rpg-mapping-tools


A collection of my old mapping tools for various games



This will contain maps I wrote for games I wrote guides for at GameFAQs, along with the tools I used to create the maps.



Unfortunately many of the individual maps are lost and probably not going to be replaced. But I think the applications have some merit.

# MAPCPY and MAPCONV

The main apps are mapcpy and mapconv. I built them with Visual C++ 6. They should have no Windows dependencies. They respectively copy data from binary files and use icons to convert that data to a human-readable bitmap.

# U4 and U5

My Ultima IV and V map crawlers have Windows dependencies since they are GUI. I made them to be able to poke through the Ultima dungeons without playing a game. Oh and to get comfortable with Windows graphics/GUI programming.

# Editor

This is a GUI based editor for 3-d (perspective) mapped games. I haven't documented it well, but you can use (shift)-IJKM or (shift)-arrow keys to create or change walls, as well as put in special square notifications.
