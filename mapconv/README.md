Mapconv should be buildable without much problem in Visual C. I haven't used much that's Windows specific.

The colors are of my own choosing. They seem to work for me to bring the effects I want.

One big thing to remember here is that any PIX files created aren't 100% accurate. Often they just want to give a feel for the terrain. So a lot of the PIX shortcuts help with that.

Examples of mapcpy together with mapconv in action are in the U4 and U5 folders. These require binary accessory files I won't include in the repositories, because you can find them on the Internet, especially U4.
