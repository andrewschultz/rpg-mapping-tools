You should not need anything special to build mapcpy.c.

Mapcpy.c now accesses c:\coding\games\256.bmp, which is my base directory for tinkering with games. So it should not find any stray pointers.

While I usually use *.txt as an extention, .mcp may be clearer so the user knows they're dealing with a MAPCPY file.

Examples of mapcpy together with mapconv in action are in the U4 and U5 folders. These require binary accessory files I won't include in the repositories, because you can find them on the Internet, especially U4.
