Ultima V Dungeon Surfer

Originally conceived circa 2005, restarted 2015

This Windows executable allows the user to page through all eight dungeons in Ultima 5 and all 112 rooms. Well, except for Despise, which has no rooms.

The accelerators and options are hopefully described well enough in the menus.

None of the binaries from Ultima V are included here, but DUNGEON.DAT and DUNGEON.CBT are the ones to use.

You will probably want the DSW file to build the app, though you can also just add msimg32.lib, which is needed for TransparentBlt.

At the moment, you definitely need all the BMP files.
